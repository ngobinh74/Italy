# Italy - ahrs

My developed Razor AHRS Firmware during the time I stayed in Italy based on razor-9dof-ahrs of ptrbrtz and others.
They are 9 Degree of Measurement Attitude and Heading Reference System for Sparkfun "9DOF Razor IMU" (SEN-10125 and SEN-10736) and "9DOF Sensor Stick" (SEN-10183, 10321 and SEN-10724)/GY85 (and some othes listed on HARDWARE OPTIONS).
Writen by Binh T. NGO for my DIY based on Arduino Diecimila, (Roll Pith Yaw - Red Grenn Blue). Thank to Tuantele!
